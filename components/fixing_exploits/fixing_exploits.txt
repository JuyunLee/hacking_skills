=================================
fixing memory corruption exploits
=================================
examining the exploit
	it is sometimes not work that scripts which needs interpreter such as python
	so, generally native compiled exploits are recommended
cross-compiling the exploit code
	cross-compiler : can compile for other os
		windows : mingw-w64
		i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <c file> -o <output file>
		if use winsock, add -lws2_32 option
changing the socket information
	change hard-coded parameter and re-compile it
changing the return address
changing the payload
changing the overflow buffer

===================
fixing web exploits
===================
considerations and overview
	HTTP or HTTPS?
	path or route based?
	exploit leverate a pro-authentication vulnerability?
	if not, how the exploit authenticate to the web application?
	GET or POST parameters
	the vulnerability is on default or special setting
	self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?
selecting the vulnerability
	exploit-db or etc
	search
changing connectivity information
	target url
troubleshooting the 'index out of range' error
